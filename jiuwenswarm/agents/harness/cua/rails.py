    ``delivery_mode`` is a per-call cua-driver argument that decides whether

    delivered via a brief foreground swap (``foreground``). The driver defaults
    to ``background``, but nothing stops a model from passing ``foreground``
    preemptively and stealing the user's focus.

    This rail makes the choice an operator setting rather than a model one:

    - The mode is injected into every delivery-capable call that did not
      already request it, so a configured mode also holds for calls that simply
      omit the argument (required for ``foreground``, whose absence would
      otherwise fall back to the driver's ``background`` default).
    - Under ``background``, an explicit ``foreground`` request is rejected
      rather than rewritten. The driver's own ``background_unavailable`` error
      tells the model to retry with ``foreground``; silently rewriting that
      retry back to ``background`` would loop the model against the driver's
      advice with no signal that its escalation was discarded.

    Not installed unless a mode is configured, so the default agent keeps the
    driver's own behavior.

    make every payload unique -- this rail replaces it with a one-line
    "unchanged" note: the driver has still refreshed its element cache, so the
    indices from the retained earlier copy stay valid.

    At most ``keep_last_k - 1`` consecutive snapshots are collapsed per key:
    the window processor keeps only the newest ``keep_last_k`` snapshot results
    in full, so a longer run of notes could push every full copy of the tree
    out of context. With ``keep_last_k=1`` the rail never collapses anything.

    The same digest comparison detects the opposite case for free: a snapshot
    that DIFFERS from the previous one although no cua action ran in between
    means the app mutates its own UI (loading screens, async content). That is
    exactly the dynamic case the action-based CuaSnapshotFreshnessRail cannot
    see, so the first such change per window gets a warning that element
    indices there go stale on their own.

    - at ``advise_after`` identical non-success responses the result is
      annotated, telling the model the repeat is not working;
    - at ``block_after`` the call is refused before it reaches the driver.

    Two signals, both provisional -- unlike every other rail in this file,
    no recorded cua run corpus validates these thresholds yet:

    1. State-revisit loop detection. CuaSnapshotDedupRail already collapses
       a snapshot that is byte-identical to the IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING one of
       the same window. That misses cycling back to a state seen several
       actions ago (dialog A -> dialog B -> dialog A), where the
       intervening snapshot(s) differ so nothing collapses. This rail keeps
       a short bounded history of content digests per (pid, window_id) --
       normalized the same way CuaSnapshotDedupRail is, by stripping the
       fields the driver regenerates every call -- and appends a replan
       advisory once a digest reappears often enough.

       Must run BEFORE CuaSnapshotDedupRail in the rail list (enforced by
       injection order in create_worker(), not priority -- this file's
       cua rails all use the default priority) so it always sees the
       driver's raw response text. After dedup collapses a repeat into its
       short "unchanged" note, that note's digest would no longer match the
       original content's digest and revisits would silently stop being
       tracked.

    2. resume_context reporting. At run end (after_invoke) this rail
       packages what it tracked -- current window, accumulated blockers,
       revisit count, a resume counter persisted in session state across
       delegations -- into ``result["cua_result"]``, mirroring how
       browser_agent's runtime attaches ``authoritative_browser_result``.
       Jiuwen's cua_task returns this as ``desktop_state`` to Core Agent.
       Its invocations use fresh sessions; the retained upstream resume counter
       does not imply that persistent task resumption is supported here.
       ``status``/``recommended_recovery`` here are simple
       heuristics derived from whether a blocker or the revisit threshold
       was hit -- not an authoritative task-completion judgment the way
       browser's phase-tracked status is.
