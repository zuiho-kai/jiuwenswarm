"""Runtime build context for swarm provider-based team assembly.

``SwarmBuildContext`` carries the live, non-serializable jiuwenswarm handles
a capability provider needs at build time. It extends openjiuwen's
``BuildContext`` so openjiuwen's ``setup_agent`` can fill the per-member view
(``member_name`` / ``role`` / ``workspace`` / ``member_card_id``) via
``derive()`` while the platform attaches the per-team/per-process handles.

It deliberately holds no parent DeepAgent: team members build from the shared
config source (``config.yaml``), not by inheriting a pre-built single agent.

class SwarmBuildContext(BuildContext):
    """BuildContext subclass carrying jiuwenswarm runtime handles.

    Per-team / per-process fields are set once when enriching the team spec.
    Per-member fields (``member_name`` / ``role`` / ``language`` / ``workspace``
    / ``member_card_id``) are inherited from ``BuildContext`` and filled by
    openjiuwen's ``setup_agent`` through ``derive()``.

    Attributes:
        session_id: Active session id.
        request_id: Originating request id (may be None).
        user_id: Authenticated request owner, used by user-routed tools.
        channel_id: Raw channel id from the request (may be None).
        channel: Resolved channel key for ``get_team_manager`` (``channel_id``
            or "default").
        request_metadata: Request metadata dict (carries ``mode`` etc.).
        mode: Request mode (e.g. "team"); replaces the old parent
            ``_jiuwenswarm_adapter_mode`` lookup.
        project_dir: Resolved project directory (from request / session /
            config); replaces the old parent ``_jiuwenswarm_project_dir``.
        trusted_dirs: Directories the client declared as trusted for this
            request. Members feed them to the runtime-prompt and permission
            rails so an external-directory check treats these subtrees as
            internal, matching single-agent behaviour.
        team_id: Team name.
        team_ws_root: Team shared workspace root path.
        task_workspace_root: Root of the shared final-deliverables directory
            a projectless team member is told about (``team-workspace/artifacts
            /<date>/chat-<n>/``). Only set when ``project_dir`` is None — a
            team member bound to a project keeps deliverables in the project
            and these stay None so the runtime prompt rail's
            ``has_projectless_task`` branch stays off. The per-member
            ``task_work_dir`` (the member workspace the prompt names as the
            temporary working directory) is resolved in the rail from each
            member's workspace root, not carried here — it is per-member.
        team_outputs_dir: The final-deliverables directory (under
            ``task_workspace_root``). Declared here explicitly (though the
            base ``BuildContext`` also carries it once openjiuwen catches up)
            so construction does not depend on the pinned openjiuwen version,
            and the openjiuwen configurator and the team policy rail can
            surface it to the team info body without a platform-specific
            accessor. None when project_dir is set.
        team_skill_visibility_path: Team-level Skill visibility metadata file
            (``team_ws_root/skills-visibility.json``). Replaces the former
            ``team_skills_dir``: a team owns no Skill directory of its own, only
            a metadata document composed with each member's document. The
            member-level counterpart is not a field but the
            :meth:`resolve_member_skill_visibility_path` method, because it can
            only be derived once the per-member view has been filled in.
        global_skills_dir: The one physical Skill library every agent reads.
        trajectory_span_processor: Process-level trajectory span processor
            shared by Team evolution rails.
        heartbeat_job_service: Process-level AgentServer Heartbeat service.
            This live handle is intentionally omitted from serialized seeds and
            reacquired from the receiving JiuwenSwarm process.
        config: The resolved ``config.yaml`` mapping (``get_config()``).
        skill_retrieval_toolkit: Per-member, non-serializable Symphony
            discovery runtime shared by skill_index and its prompt rail.

    Note:
        Backward incompatible: the ``team_skills_dir`` field and its seed key
        were removed. A seed produced by an older process carries no
        ``team_skill_visibility_path`` and rebuilds with ``None``, which leaves
        the member document as the only visibility authority.
