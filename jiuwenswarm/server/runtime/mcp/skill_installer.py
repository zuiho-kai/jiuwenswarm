"""MCP skill installer.

Copies a marketplace MCP's bundled skills (form C CLI / form D skill-only)
into ``<workspace>/mcp/skills/<name>/``. Skills surface to the agent via
``connected_mcp_skill_dirs`` (state.json) + SkillUseRail directory scanning —
no SkillManager enabled-flag toggle. Idempotent.

Marketplace skill layouts vary, so discovery handles two shapes:
  * nested:  ``skills/<skill>/(SKILL.md|*.md)`` -> one skill per subdir.
  * flat:    ``skills/SKILL.md`` (optionally with references/scripts/) ->
             the whole ``skills/`` dir is one skill named after the MCP.

Form A/B (remote/stdio MCP) have no bundled skills; this module is a no-op.
