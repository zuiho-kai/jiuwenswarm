# Browser tools

> **Note:** This page documents the **server-side managed browser** (the agent's Chrome driver).
> For the **browser extension** that puts JiuwenSwarm beside any page you read, see
> [Browser Extension](browser-extension/BrowserExtension.md).

## 1. Overview

JiuwenSwarm browser tools drive a real Chrome instance for navigation, form
filling, clicks, uploads, and other web tasks.

Chrome is managed by the browser agent. The user configures the Chrome
executable and display mode in the web UI, and the agent starts the browser on
the first browser task. There is no separate browser service to start from the
frontend.

JiuwenSwarm ships a browser-free `@playwright/mcp@0.0.78` runtime, so the
healthy browser path does not contact npm. Chrome itself is not bundled.
Desktop releases and the Docker image include Node 22.11.0; pip/wheel and
source installations need Node.js 20 or newer only when browser runtime
support is enabled. Normal application startup and non-browser agents do not
require Node.js.

The managed browser can:

- Open pages and wait for loading
- Click elements, enter text, and upload files
- Execute multi-step web tasks
- Reuse a session and its login state
- Read page titles, URLs, and page content

## 2. Quick start

### 2.1 Install Chrome

Install Google Chrome on the machine that runs JiuwenSwarm. The managed driver
normally detects a standard Chrome installation automatically.

If Chrome is installed in a custom location, open `chrome://version`, copy the
**Executable Path**, and use it in the next step.

### 2.2 Configure the browser

1. Open the JiuwenSwarm web UI.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Browser**.
3. Optionally enter the full Chrome executable path. Leave it empty to use
   automatic detection.
4. Enable **Show browser** when you need to see or manually authenticate in the
   managed browser. Disable it for headless execution.
5. Save the settings.

Changing the display mode restarts the browser runtime when necessary so the
next task uses the selected mode.

### 2.3 Run a browser task

Ask the agent to open a page, extract information, fill a form, or continue an
authenticated workflow. The browser agent starts and owns Chrome automatically.

In visible mode, the Chrome window appears when the first browser task starts.
Complete login, MFA, or other required manual authorization in that window, then
continue the task in the conversation.

## 3. Usage guidance

- Keep the same agent session for long workflows that depend on login state.
- Use visible mode for manual login, MFA, QR codes, and authorization prompts.
- Use headless mode for tasks that do not require manual interaction.
- Do not start a separate Chrome with a fixed debugging port for normal
  JiuwenSwarm usage. The managed driver selects and injects the correct CDP
  endpoint.
- Keep `BROWSER_ALLOW_SHORT_TIMEOUT_OVERRIDE=0` unless short browser task
  timeouts are explicitly required.

## 4. Examples

### 4.1 Extract web information

1. Ask: "Extract today's headlines and summaries from
   https://example.com/news."
2. The agent starts the managed browser, visits the page, and returns the
   requested information.

### 4.2 Send email with an attachment

1. Enable **Show browser** and save the setting.
2. Ask the agent to open Gmail.
3. Sign in in the managed Chrome window if required.
4. Ask the agent to compose the message and attach the file.

## 5. Configuration

### 5.1 `config.yaml`

| Configuration | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `browser.chrome_path` | string/map | `""` | Chrome executable. Empty uses automatic detection. A map may provide OS-specific paths. |
| `browser.headless` | boolean | `true` | `false` shows the managed browser window. |

Example:

```yaml
browser:
  chrome_path:
    windows: "C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe"
    macos: "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
    linux: "/usr/bin/google-chrome"
  headless: true
```

An empty `chrome_path` clears any previously configured binary and lets
openJiuwen detect Chrome from the system. A non-empty path is authoritative: if
it does not identify a Chrome executable, browser startup reports an error
instead of silently using another installation.

### 5.2 Advanced environment overrides

Most installations do not need these variables. The `BROWSER_MANAGED_*` series are runtime-internal variables, automatically derived by the system from the `browser.*` section of `config.yaml`; **do not set them manually in `.env`** unless for advanced troubleshooting or override.

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BROWSER_PROFILE_NAME` | `Default` (`.env.template`) / `jiuwenclaw` (runtime default) | Browser profile name; see `.env.template` line 101. |
| `BROWSER_DRIVER` | `managed` in JiuwenSwarm | Browser driver mode. |
| `BROWSER_MANAGED_BINARY` | auto-detected (from `browser.chrome_path`) | Path to the managed Chrome executable; at runtime the system sets this automatically based on `browser.chrome_path` in `config.yaml`. |
| `BROWSER_MANAGED_PORT` | `9333` | Port for the unkeyed managed Chrome instance (different from `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_PORT`; the latter is the MCP wrapper port, default 8940); keyed instances allocate free ports automatically. |
| `BROWSER_MANAGED_USER_DATA_DIR` | managed profile directory (default under the runtime state root) | Overrides the managed profile directory. |
| `BROWSER_MANAGED_ARGS` | derived from display mode (e.g., `--headless=new`) | Additional Chrome startup arguments; derived at runtime from `browser.headless`, etc. |
| `BROWSER_MANAGED_KILL_EXISTING` | `false` | Allows the driver to terminate a matching existing Chrome before launch. Use only when profile ownership is understood. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_COMMAND` | unset | External-mode command override. Setting either Playwright MCP override disables the bundle. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ARGS` | unset | JSON list or shell-style external-mode arguments. Set both variables for a direct executable. |

`PLAYWRIGHT_CDP_URL` is intended for explicit remote-driver setups. It is not
required for the normal managed-browser flow.

When only one Playwright MCP override is set, the unspecified field uses the
pinned `npx -y @playwright/mcp@0.0.78` default. The same pinned npx command is
used, with a prominent warning, if bundle verification or local Node
resolution fails; that fallback may access the npm registry.

#### 5.2.1 Browser MCP runtime variables

The following variables control how the browser MCP runtime wrapper starts and communicates (see `.env.template` lines 64-86; for MCP configuration see [MCP Configuration](MCPConfiguration.md)).

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_ENABLED` | `1` | Master switch for the browser MCP runtime (0 disable / 1 enable). |
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_CLIENT_TYPE` | `streamable-http` | MCP client type: `stdio` / `sse` / `streamable-http` (recommended). |
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_SERVER_ID` | `playwright_runtime_wrapper` | MCP server ID (registration identifier). |
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_SERVER_NAME` | `playwright-runtime-wrapper` | MCP server display name. |
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_SERVER_PATH` | `http://127.0.0.1:8940/mcp` | MCP server endpoint URL (`streamable-http` defaults to `/mcp`, `sse` defaults to `/sse`; under `stdio` it is metadata only). |
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_TIMEOUT_S` | `300` | MCP request timeout (seconds). |
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Local wrapper host (used for auto-launch). |
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_PORT` | `8940` | Local wrapper port (different from `BROWSER_MANAGED_PORT`; the latter is the managed Chrome instance port, default 9333). |
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_PATH` | `/mcp` | Local wrapper path (used for auto-launch). |
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_COMMAND` | empty | Override for the `stdio` mode launch command (empty means use the current Python executable). |
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_ARGS` | empty | Override for the `stdio` mode launch arguments (empty means use built-in defaults). |
| `BROWSER_RUNTIME_MCP_AUTO_SSE_FALLBACK` | `1` | Whether `stdio` mode first attempts SSE fallback (1 enabled, recommended). |

## 6. Architecture

The browser lifecycle is:

`frontend settings -> bundled MCP extraction -> managed Chrome start -> CDP injection -> task execution -> session reuse`

- The frontend `BrowserPanel` only reads and saves Chrome path and display mode.
- JiuwenSwarm maps those settings to the browser-agent runtime.
- openJiuwen's `BrowserService` and `ManagedBrowserDriver` allocate the endpoint,
  start Chrome on demand, monitor it, reuse the profile, and stop it with the
  agent lifecycle.
- The Playwright MCP endpoint is injected from the managed browser instance; it
  is not supplied by a frontend-launched browser.

### 6.1 Core code

| Module | File path | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Frontend BrowserPanel | `jiuwenswarm/channels/web/frontend/src/components/BrowserPanel/index.tsx` | Reads and saves Chrome path and display mode |
| Backend Web RPC handlers | `jiuwenswarm/gateway/channel_manager/web/app_web_handlers.py` | Provides `path.get`, `path.set` endpoints |
| Browser subagent integration | `openjiuwen.harness.subagents.browser_agent` | Browser subagent configuration and lifecycle integration |
| Chrome launch and management | `openjiuwen.harness.tools.browser_move.drivers.managed_browser` | `ManagedBrowserDriver`: port allocation, Chrome process management, profile reuse |
| Browser runtime orchestration | `openjiuwen.harness.tools.browser_move.playwright_runtime.runtime` | Runtime orchestration layer |
| Browser task execution | `openjiuwen.harness.tools.browser_move.playwright_runtime.service` | Task execution, session reuse, timeout guardrails, driver lifecycle management |
| Browser runtime config | `openjiuwen.harness.tools.browser_move.playwright_runtime.config` | Playwright MCP and runtime configuration parsing |

## 7. Summary

Browser tools let agents operate on a real Chrome instance that the user has
already authorized. The frontend handles configuration; the backend manages
automatic startup and execution.
