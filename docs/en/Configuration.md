# Configuration Information

JiuwenSwarm configuration serves as the foundational setup for your interactions with the agent. Proper configuration allows you to connect to various model services, enable multimodal capabilities, integrate third-party services, and adjust system behavior parameters.

This document details each configuration option in the JiuwenSwarm frontend panel to help you get started quickly and fully leverage the system's capabilities.

---

## 1. Configuration Entry

Click **More** → **Configuration** in the left navigation bar to view and edit settings for models, third-party services, free search, and more. Click **Save** after changes; whether you need to wait for services to become ready depends on your deployment.

![Configuration Panel](../assets/images/current-ui-en/07-Configuration-Model-Tab.png)

The configuration panel is organized into three tabs:

- **Model**: Default chat model, video/audio/vision models, Embedding configuration (see [2. Model Configuration](#2-model-configuration))
- **Security**: Tool security guardrails, sensitive-info filtering (see [7. Tool Security Guardrails](#7-tool-security-guardrails))
- **Other**: Third-party services, self-evolution, context compression, skill symphony, etc.

> 💡 **Tip**: Model configuration (`api_base`, `api_key`, `model`, `model_provider`) is required; all other configurations are optional.

---

## 2. Model Configuration

> Before using JiuwenSwarm, you must obtain an API key from your chosen model provider. Visit the provider's official website and follow instructions to apply for an API key.

### 2.1 Supported Model Types

JiuwenSwarm supports multiple model types to meet diverse scenario requirements:

| Model Type       | Purpose                                                                 | Capability Requirements                                                                 | Required |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Default Model** | Core dialogue model; handles text chat, task planning, tool calling, etc | Must support **Function Calling** and multi-turn dialogue                                 | ✅ Yes    |
| **Video Model**   | Video understanding and analysis; supports video Q&A, scene detection    | Must support **video understanding** and process video input                             | ⭕ No     |
| **Audio Model**   | Speech recognition and processing; supports ASR, audio content analysis   | Must support **speech recognition / audio understanding**                                 | ⭕ No     |
| **Vision Model**  | Image understanding and analysis; supports image Q&A, OCR, captioning    | Must support **image understanding** and process image input                              | ⭕ No     |
| **Image Generation Model** | Generate images from text descriptions; supports AI painting, image creation | Must support **image generation** and create images from text | ⭕ No     |

> 💡 **Tip**: The default model is essential for system operation and must be configured correctly. Video, audio, vision, and image generation models are optional; configure them only when multimodal capabilities are needed. The image generation model is not shown in the frontend configuration panel yet; configure it via the main config (`models.image_gen`) or environment variables (`IMAGE_GEN_API_BASE`, etc.).

### 2.2 Configuration Fields

Each model type supports the following parameters:

| Field (frontend) | Backend field (config.yaml) | Description                  | Remarks                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `api_base`       | `api_base`                  | Base URL for model API        | Use the provider's API endpoint; **do not include `/chat/completions`**; appended automatically |
| `api_key`        | `api_key`                   | Model API key                | Obtained from the model provider; keep confidential                                           |
| `model`          | `model_name`                | Model identifier             | Use exact model ID such as `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-opus`, `deepseek-chat`                                         |
| `model_provider` | `client_provider`           | Model provider type          | Supports `OpenAI`, `DeepSeek`, `DashScope`, `SiliconFlow`, `AscendAffinity`, `OpenRouter` for API format adaptation; video/audio/vision models currently support `OpenAI` only |

> 💡 **Field Mapping**: The frontend panel uses `model` / `model_provider` as display field names; when saved to `config.yaml` they are mapped to backend fields `model_name` / `client_provider`. Both refer to the same thing, only the naming in the config file differs.

> 💡 **Test Function**: The configuration panel provides a **Test button**. After filling in the model configuration, you can click "Test" to verify the API connection. The system will send a simple test request and display "Test Successful" if successful, or show error information otherwise.

![Model Configuration Tab](../assets/images/current-ui-en/07-Configuration-Model-Tab.png)

#### Configuration Examples

**OpenAI-compatible API**

```
api_base: https://api.openai.com/v1
api_key: sk-your-openai-api-key
model: gpt-4o
model_provider: OpenAI
```

**DeepSeek**

```
api_base: https://api.deepseek.com/v1
api_key: sk-your-deepseek-api-key
model: deepseek-chat
model_provider: DeepSeek
```

**SiliconFlow**

```
api_base: https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1
api_key: sk-your-siliconflow-api-key
model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct
model_provider: SiliconFlow
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Most model providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs. You can adjust `api_base` and `model` parameters based on your actual provider.

### 2.3 Multi-Model Management and Aliases

The **Model List** section in the configuration panel supports maintaining multiple models simultaneously for quick switching between different models.

Each model entry contains the following fields:

| Field (frontend) | Backend field (config.yaml) | Required | Description |
|------|---------|---------|------|
| `model_name` | `model_name` | Yes | Model name at the API layer (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `deepseek-chat`) |
| `api_base` | `api_base` | Yes | API endpoint for this model |
| `api_key` | `api_key` | Yes | API key for this model |
| `model_provider` | `client_provider` | Yes | Provider (e.g., `OpenAI`, `DeepSeek`) |
| `reasoning_level` | `reasoning_level` | No | Reasoning intensity; optional `off` / `low` / `medium` / `high`; leave empty to unset |
| `temperature` | `temperature` | No | Sampling temperature, default `0.95` |

**`alias` Rules**:
- If empty, it automatically defaults to `model_name` when saved;
- Must be globally unique across all configured models: cannot duplicate another model's `alias` or `model_name`;
- When switching models (Web dropdown / CLI `/model <name>`), you can use either `alias` or `model_name` as the identifier.

The model marked with `is_default: true` is the default-used model; you can switch the default flag via the "Set as Default" button.

### 2.4 Multimodal Model Usage Examples

Once video, audio, or vision models are configured, JiuwenSwarm enables corresponding multimodal features automatically. Below are application scenarios for each model type:

#### Video Model

Using **GLM-4.6V-Flash11** video understanding API as an example:

When you send a video file to JiuwenSwarm and ask a question, the system will invoke the video model for analysis:

```
User: Analyze this video and list the main scenes.
[Attachment: meeting_recording.mp4]

JiuwenSwarm: Based on video analysis, the main scenes are:
1. Opening remarks (0:00–2:30)
2. Project progress report (2:30–8:15)
3. Issue discussion (8:15–12:00)
4. Summary and next steps (12:00–15:00)
```

![Video Model Configuration Example](../assets/images/config_video_model_demo.png)

#### Audio Model

Using **GLM-ASR-2512** audio model as an example:

When you send an audio file, the system will invoke the audio model for speech recognition or analysis:

```
User: Transcribe this audio recording.
[Attachment: voice_message.m4a]

JiuwenSwarm: Transcription:
"Project review meeting at 3 PM tomorrow in Conference Room B. Please prepare materials in advance..."
```

![Audio Model Configuration Example](../assets/images/config_audio_model_demo.png)

#### Vision Model

Using **GLM-4.6V-Flash11** vision model as an example:

When you send an image and ask a question, the system will invoke the vision model for image understanding:

```
User: Extract data from the table in this image.
[Attachment: data_chart.png]

JiuwenSwarm: Extracted sales data:
- January: 1.2M
- February: 1.35M
- March: 1.48M
Showing an upward trend...
```

![Vision Model](../assets/images/config-vision-model-test.png)

## 3. Embedding Configuration

Embedding models convert text into vector representations and form the core of JiuwenSwarm's memory system for semantic retrieval.

### 3.1 Purpose

- **Semantic search**: Vectorize memory content for similarity-based retrieval rather than simple keyword matching
- **Memory recall**: Improve accuracy when querying historical information
- **Hybrid retrieval**: Combine with BM25 full-text search for optimal recall

> 💡 **Tip**: Embedding configuration is optional. If not set, the system uses a mock provider for basic retrieval. Configuring an embedding model improves semantic search precision. See the [Memory](Memory.md) documentation for details.

> 💡 **Frontend Fields and Environment Variables**: The frontend fields below are saved to the `embed` section of `config.yaml`; if not set via the frontend, they can also be injected via environment variables, which take precedence over the config file. Mapping: `embed_api_key` ↔ `EMBED_API_KEY`, `embed_api_base` ↔ `EMBED_API_BASE` (field name in config.yaml is `embed_base_url`), `embed_model` ↔ `EMBED_MODEL`.

### 3.2 Configuration Fields

| Field (frontend) | Backend field (config.yaml) | Description                     | Reference Format                        | Remarks                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `embed_api_base` | `embed_base_url`            | Base URL for embedding API      | `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1`         | Embedding service API endpoint            |
| `embed_api_key`  | `embed_api_key`             | Embedding service API key       | `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`                   | Obtained from the service provider        |
| `embed_model`    | `embed_model`               | Embedding model name            | `BAAI/xxx`                              | Chinese-optimized embedding recommended   |

---

## 4. Third-Party Service Configuration

This section summarizes configuration for search and external services. All items below appear on the **Configuration** page (all optional).

| Field | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jina_api_key` | Jina; web scraping and some search capabilities | [Jina](https://jina.ai/) |
| `bocha_api_key` | Bocha Web Search | [Bocha Open Platform](https://open.bochaai.com/) |
| `serper_api_key` | Serper Search | [Serper](https://serper.dev/) |
| `perplexity_api_key` | Perplexity | [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) |
| `github_token` | GitHub; SkillNet, etc. | [GitHub Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) |
| `teamskills_user_token` | TeamSkillsHub user token | [TeamSkillsHub](https://teamskills.openjiuwen.com) |

> ⚠️ **Note**: All optional. If unset, related features may be unavailable or fall back to degraded strategies; exact behavior depends on your product version.

Two additional related configuration groups:

- **Free Search Engine Configuration**:
  - `free_search_ddg_enabled` (DuckDuckGo toggle) and `free_search_bing_enabled` (Bing toggle): control whether the free search engines are enabled. These two toggles are set via the "Configuration" page on the frontend and reset to `false` on every process startup; they must be explicitly enabled in the UI.
  - `FREE_SEARCH_PROXY_URL`, `FREE_SEARCH_SSL_VERIFY`, `FREE_SEARCH_DDG_URL`: DuckDuckGo endpoint URL, SSL verification, and proxy URL, written to `.env`. Bing is not enabled by default.
- **Other TeamSkillsHub settings**: `teamskills_market_url` (marketplace URL), `teamskills_system_token` (system token), and `teamskills_allowed_download_hosts` (allowed download hosts), configured as needed.

---

## 5. Self-Evolution Configuration

Self-evolution controls the automatic improvement of JiuwenSwarm's Skills.

![Self-Evolution Configuration Example](../assets/images/config_self_evolve.png)

### Configuration

Common self-evolution settings are listed below:

| Setting | Config key | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Enable Skills Self-Evolution** | `react.evolution.skill_evolution` | `false` | Controls automatic Skill creation and evolution together. When off, the related Rails, tools, prompts, watchers, and `/evolve` commands are unavailable |
| **Minimum Reviewer Feedback confidence** | `react.evolution.review_feedback_min_confidence` | `0.7` | Process only Reviewer Feedback attributions that meet this confidence threshold |

> 💡 **Note**: `react.evolution.auto_save` remains an advanced YAML-only approval setting and is not shown in the frontend. With `auto_save=false`, Reviewer Feedback-driven Team Skill updates require approval. Explicit use of the general `skill-creator` or `swarmskill-creator` capability is independent from this automatic self-evolution switch.

> 📖 For details on the self-evolution mechanism, see [Skill Self-Evolution](SkillSelfEvolution.md).

---

## 6. Context Compression

Context compression manages dialogue history retention strategies.

![Context Compression Configuration Example](../assets/images/config_context_compress.png)

### Toggle

- **Field**: `react.context_engine_config.enabled`
- **Default**: `true` (enabled)
- **Purpose**: Automatically compress and offload dialogue history when exceeding context window limits to maintain fluent interaction.

When enabled, the system will:

1. Monitor message count and token usage
2. Archive low-priority content when thresholds are reached
3. Preserve lightweight indexes to free space for ongoing tasks

### KV Cache Compute Affinity

KV Cache compute affinity manages Session cache through the unified `agent_hint` protocol.

- **Field**: `kv_cache_affinity_config.enable_kv_cache_affinity`
- **Default**: `false` (disabled)
- **Purpose**: When enabled, the system prefetches, offloads, and evicts KV Cache along the Session lifecycle.

**KV Cache Explanation**:
- KV Cache is a cache used by large language models during inference to store intermediate computation results
- As conversation rounds increase, KV Cache continues to grow, consuming significant GPU memory
- Suspended Sessions can offload cache, resumed Sessions can prefetch it, and permanently released Sessions evict it.

**Applicable Scenarios**:
- Long-running conversations requiring extensive history retention
- Environments with limited GPU memory
- Tasks requiring ultra-long context processing

> 📖 For details on the context compression mechanism, see [Context Compression & Offloading](ContextCompression.md).

---

## 7. Tool Security Guardrails

Security guardrails enforce permission checks during tool invocation.

![Tool Security Guardrails Configuration Example](../assets/images/config_tool_security_guard.png)

### Toggle

- **Field**: `permissions.enabled`
- **Default**: `false` (disabled)
- **Purpose**: When enabled, the system performs permission checks before sensitive tool operations and follows policies to allow, prompt for confirmation, or deny actions.

When enabled, the system will:

1. Check permission rules for each tool call
2. Resolve action: `allow`, `ask`, or `deny`
3. Prompt user confirmation for `ask`-classified operations

### Example Permission Rules

```yaml
permissions:
  enabled: true
  schema: tiered_policy
  permission_mode: normal  # normal | strict; maps severity to action
  defaults:
    "*": "allow"           # Allow all actions by default
  tools:
    bash: ask              # Require confirmation for command execution
    powershell: ask
    mcp_exec_command: ask
    write_file: ask
  rules:
    - id: shell_allow_ls
      tools: [bash, powershell, mcp_exec_command, create_terminal]
      pattern: "ls *"
      severity: LOW        # normal mode: LOW/MEDIUM → allow
    - id: shell_ask_rm
      tools: [bash, powershell, mcp_exec_command, create_terminal]
      pattern: "rm *"
      severity: HIGH       # normal mode: HIGH/CRITICAL → ask
```

---

## 8. Memory Sensitive-Info Filtering

Memory sensitive-info filtering protects user privacy by preventing sensitive information from being written to the memory system.

### Toggle

- **Field**: `memory.forbidden_memory_definition.enabled`
- **Default**: `false` (disabled)
- **Purpose**: When enabled, the system automatically detects and filters sensitive information before writing to memory, matching against `memory.forbidden_memory_definition.patterns`.

> 💡 **Note**: This switch is off by default and must be enabled manually. When enabled, the system matches sensitive information according to `forbidden_memory_definition.patterns`; the `description` field records the filter policy description text (Chinese/English).

### Filtered Content Types

The system automatically identifies and filters the following types of sensitive information:

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Personal Identity Information** | Names, ID numbers, phone numbers, etc. | Zhang San, 110101199001011234 |
| **Bank Account Information** | Bank card numbers, Alipay/WeChat accounts | 622202\*\*\*\*\*1234 |
| **Address Information** | Detailed home or company addresses | No. X Street, Chaoyang District, Beijing |
| **Email Addresses** | Personal or work email | xxx@example.com |
| **Passwords / Keys** | Various passwords, API keys, etc. | password123, sk-xxxx |

> 📖 For details on the memory system, see the [Memory](Memory.md) documentation.

## 9. Skill Symphony and Skill Retrieval Configuration

Symphony settings control two related capabilities: **Skill Retrieval** finds candidate skills from installed skills, and **Skill Orchestration** uses the skill graph to organize candidates into a confirmable, executable skill chain.

### 9.1 Frontend switches

The configuration panel exposes two related switches:

| Switch | Config key | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Enable Skill Retrieval** | `symphony.skill_retrieval.enabled` | `false` | Registers skill-tree retrieval tools such as `skill_branch_explore`, `skill_branch_peek`, and `skill_index_build` |
| **Enable Skill Symphony** | `symphony.enabled` | `false` | Registers skill graph and orchestration tools such as `symphony_read_graph`, `symphony_refresh_graph`, and `symphony_compose_graph` |

The two switches are independent. Skill Retrieval answers "how to find candidate skills"; Skill Symphony answers "how to orchestrate candidate skills into a route". If only Skill Retrieval is enabled, the system only gets skill-tree retrieval. If only Skill Symphony is enabled, the system can read and refresh the skill graph, but candidate skills do not automatically come from Skill Retrieval.

### 9.2 Skill index and skill graph

Related pages are under **Skills** in the left sidebar:

| Page | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Skill Index** | Builds the local installed-skill tree index used for step-by-step retrieval |
| **Skill Graph** | Builds and displays connectable relationships between skills for orchestration |

After installing, uninstalling, or heavily modifying skills, rebuild the skill index. If the skill changes affect relationships between skills, also run an incremental build or full rebuild on the Skill Graph page.

### 9.3 Symphony settings in the main config

Advanced build, retrieval, and orchestration parameters are configured in the user runtime config file:

```text
~/.jiuwenswarm/config/config.yaml
```

Common settings:

The retained `symphony.fingerprint.scan` and `symphony.fingerprint.extraction`
settings are mapped by the JiuwenSwarm Adapter to agent-core's
`SkillFolderScanner` and `FingerprintService` configuration.

| Setting | Default | Description |

## 10. Advanced Configuration

Beyond the **Configuration** page, the product may use a **main configuration** for timeouts, temperature, context thresholds, and toggles that work together with **context compression**, **permissions**, **memory restrictions**, and similar UI switches. The main config file is typically located at:

```text
~/.jiuwenswarm/config/config.yaml
```

### 10.1 Common logical keys (conceptual paths)

These are **conceptual** paths in the main configuration for cross-reference with ops or release notes; they are **not** a one-to-one list of every UI field.

| Item (conceptual path) | Description | Typical default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `preferred_language` | UI language | `zh` |
| `models.*.model_client_config.timeout` | Model request timeout (seconds) | `1800` |
| `models.*.model_client_config.verify_ssl` | Verify SSL | `false` |
| `models.*.model_config_obj.temperature` | Temperature | `0.95` |
| `react.context_engine_config.dialogue_compressor_config.trigger_context_ratio` | Dialogue compression trigger ratio of the effective context budget | `0.8` |
| `react.context_engine_config.dialogue_compressor_config.min_target_context_ratio` | Dialogue compression target lower bound (fraction of window) | `0.1` |
| `react.context_engine_config.round_level_compressor_config.trigger_context_ratio` | Round-level compression trigger ratio of the effective context budget | `0.8` |
| `react.context_engine_config.round_level_compressor_config.min_target_context_ratio` | Round-level compression target lower bound (fraction of window) | `0.1` |
| `react.context_engine_config.round_level_compressor_config.keep_recent_messages` | Round-level compression: number of recent messages to keep | `4` |

<a id="dotenv-configuration"></a>

### 10.2 Runtime parameters outside the Configuration page

Fine-grained options for browser automation, network proxies, or some search paths may be supplied by the **runtime or deployment template** and **may not** appear on the **Configuration** page. Typical users only need required UI fields and business keys; leave the rest to admins or ops.

### 10.3 Precedence (conceptual)

Generally, from highest to lowest: **values you save in the web Configuration UI** → **environment-injected variables** → **built-in product defaults**. Exact behavior depends on your version and deployment.

> 💡 **Tip**: If changes do not seem to apply immediately, wait briefly or ask an admin whether services have reloaded.

## FAQ

### Q: Configurations not taking effect after saving?

A: The system hot-reloads configuration after saving (and only schedules a process restart when necessary). Please wait a few moments and retry. If issues persist, verify configuration format correctness.

### Q: How to view the currently active model?

A: Model information is displayed on the configuration panel. You may also check system logs for the actual model being called.

### Q: Are multimodal models required?

A: No. Video, audio, and vision models are optional and only required for their respective multimodal functions.

### Q: Does `api_base` need the `/chat/completions` suffix?

A: No. `api_base` only needs to go up to the version level (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`); the system appends `/chat/completions` automatically. Adding the suffix manually may cause duplicate request paths and errors. Use the "Test" button to verify connectivity after configuration.

### Q: What to do when `alias` conflicts in the model list?

A: `alias` must be globally unique across all configured models and cannot duplicate another model's `alias` or `model_name`. When left empty, the system auto-assigns it as `model_name`. On conflict, manually assign a different `alias`; when switching models (Web dropdown or `/model <name>`), either `alias` or `model_name` can be used as the identifier.

### Q: What happens if Embed configuration is not filled in?

A: No critical impact. Embed is optional; when unset, the system uses a Mock Provider for basic retrieval. Configuring it provides more precise semantic search and better memory recall. Chinese-optimized embedding models are recommended.

### Q: Is Tool Security Guardrails enabled by default?

A: No. Tool Security Guardrails corresponds to `permissions.enabled`, which defaults to `false` (disabled). When enabled, the system checks permission rules before sensitive tool operations (such as `bash`, `write_file`) and resolves to `allow`/`ask`/`deny`, prompting a confirmation dialog for `ask`.

### Q: How to apply changes after directly editing `~/.jiuwenswarm/config/config.yaml`?

A: The system automatically detects and hot-reloads the file after saving (most settings take effect immediately; a few require a process restart). If changes do not apply after a long time, check the YAML format or re-save via the Web configuration panel to trigger a refresh.
